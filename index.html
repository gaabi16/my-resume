    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p> I am an 19-year-old student from Bucharest who is attending 
        "Gheorghe Lazar" National College. I am a very perseverant, 
        hard-working person and I am putting a lot of passion in the 
        projects and courses I take part in. I am also interested in any 
        informatics-based education, back-end or front-end projects, 
        which helps me further develop my programming skills, that I
        have accumulated so far.

                    book (HTTP Methods). The technologies I used are Java,

                    all the bricks in order to win the game. The technologies I used

    <h2>Other achievements and competencies</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The IT courses I took part in 
            and the presentations I attended 
            to guided me towards learning 
            new programming strategies 
            (clean code). Some other IT 
            projects that I developed are the 
            Tic-Tac-Toe game (using 
            React), a social media app 
            (using Ruby on Rails and 
            following Michael Hartl’s 
            Tutorial) and multiple 
            educational materials (using 
            C++). 
        </li> <br />
        <li>In 2022 I participated in two 
            chemistry competitions where I 
            wrote a report regarding the 
            Atomic Theory and conducted 
            an online experiment regarding 
            the nutrients of fish meat. 
        </li> <br />
        <li>Participating in foreign language
            programs has helped me
            enhance my communication 
            skills. Some of the activities I took 
            part in featured native speakers 
            (Goethe Institut Bucharest, 
            Goethe Institut Sofia, Universität 
            Wien Sprachzentrum).
        </li> <br />
        <li>
            I have developed my integration 
            capabilities and team-player 
            competencies by participating in 
            many sports competitions with the 
            basketball teams (4Sports 
            Bucharest and BC SLAM 
            Bucharest) I have played for
            in recent years
        </li> <br />
        <li>
            I published during high school years
            math exercises in a Canadian online
            math magazine and in some Romanian
            math magazines.
